GitHub.jl provides a Julia interface to the [GitHub API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/). Using GitHub.jl, you can do things like:

- query for basic repository, organization, and user information
- programmatically take user-level actions (e.g. starring a repository, commenting on an issue, etc.)
- set up listeners that can detect and respond to repository events
- create and retrieve commit statuses (i.e. report CI pending/failure/success statuses to GitHub)

Here's a table of contents for this rather lengthy README:

[3. Authentication](#authentication)

[4. Pagination](#pagination)

[5. Handling Webhook Events](#handling-webhook-events)

## Response Types

GitHub's JSON responses are parsed and returned to the caller as types of the form `G<:GitHub.GitHubType`. Here's some useful information about these types:

- All fields are `Union{Nothing, T}`.
- Field names generally match the corresponding field in GitHub's JSON representation (the exception is `"type"`, which has the corresponding field name `typ` to avoid the obvious language conflict).
- `GitHubType`s can be passed as arguments to API methods in place of (and in combination with) regular identifying properties. For example, `create_status(repo, commit)` could be called as:

   - `create_status(::GitHub.Repo, ::GitHub.Commit)`
   - `create_status(::GitHub.Repo, ::AbstractString)` where the second argument is the SHA
   - `create_status(::AbstractString, ::GitHub.Commit)` where the first argument is the full qualified repo name
   - `create_status(::AbstractString, ::AbstractString)` where the first argument is the repo name, and the second is the SHA

Here's a table that matches up the provided `GitHubType`s with their corresponding API documentation, as well as alternative identifying values:

| type          | alternative identifying property                       | link(s) to documentation                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You can inspect which fields are available for a type `G<:GitHubType` by calling `fieldnames(G)`.

## REST Methods

GitHub.jl implements a bunch of methods that make REST requests to GitHub's API. The below sections list these methods (note that a return type of `Tuple{Vector{T}, Dict}` means the result is [paginated](#pagination)).

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests to GitHub, you'll need to generate an appropriate [access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use). Then, you can do stuff like the following (this example assumes that you set an environmental variable `GITHUB_AUTH` containing the access token):

```julia
import GitHub
myauth = GitHub.authenticate(ENV["GITHUB_AUTH"]) # don't hardcode your access tokens!
GitHub.star("JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl"; auth = myauth)  # star the GitHub.jl repo as the user identified by myauth
```

As you can see, you can propagate the identity/permissions of the `myauth` token to GitHub.jl's methods by passing `auth = myauth` as a keyword argument.

Note that if authentication is not provided, they'll be subject to the restrictions GitHub imposes on unauthenticated requests (such as [stricter rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting))

### Authenticating as a GitHub app

GitHub apps (formerly called integrations) have [their own authentication format](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/about-authentication-options-for-github-apps/)
based on [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/). When creating a GitHub app, you will be
prompted to download your app's private key. You can use this private key to
authenticate as a Github App using the `JWTAuth` type:
```
appauth = JWTAuth(1234, "privkey.pem") # Replace with your app id/privkey file
```

The following shows a complete example that opens an issue on every repository
on which your application gets installed:

```
listener = GitHub.EventListener() do event
    # On installation, open an issue on every repository we got installed in
    if event.kind == "installation"
        # Authenticate as the application
        appauth = GitHub.JWTAuth(1234, "privkey.pem")
        # Now, get permissions for this particular installation
        installation = Installation(event.payload["installation"])
        auth = create_access_token(installation, appauth)
        for repo in event.payload["repositories"]
            create_issue(GitHub.Repo(repo), auth=auth,
                params = Dict(
                    :title => "Hello World",
                    :body => "Thank you for installing me - I needed that"
            ))
        end
    end
    return HTTP.Response(200)
end
GitHub.run(listener, host=IPv4(0,0,0,0), port=8888)
```

## Pagination

GitHub will often [paginate](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination) results for requests that return multiple items. On the GitHub.jl side of things, it's pretty easy to see which methods return paginated results by referring to the [REST Methods documentation](#rest-methods); if a method returns a `Tuple{Vector{T}, Dict}`, that means its results are paginated.

Paginated methods return both the response values, and some pagination metadata. You can use the `per_page`/`page` query parameters and the `page_limit` keyword argument to configure result pagination.

For example, let's request a couple pages of GitHub.jl's PRs, and configure our result pagination to see how it works:

```julia
# show all PRs (both open and closed), and give me 3 items per page starting at page 2
julia> myparams = Dict("state" => "all", "per_page" => 3, "page" => 2);

julia> prs, page_data = pull_requests("JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl"; params = myparams, page_limit = 2);

julia> prs # 3 items per page * 2 page limit == 6 items, as expected
6-element Array{GitHub.PullRequest,1}:
 GitHub.PullRequest(44)
 GitHub.PullRequest(43)
 GitHub.PullRequest(42)
 GitHub.PullRequest(41)
 GitHub.PullRequest(39)
 GitHub.PullRequest(38)

julia> page_data
Dict{String,String} with 4 entries:
  "prev"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=2&per_page=3&state=all"
  "next"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=4&per_page=3&state=all"
  "first" => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=1&per_page=3&state=all"
  "last"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=7&per_page=3&state=all"
```

In the above, `prs` contains the results from page 2 and 3. We know this because we specified page 2 as our starting page (`"page" => 2`), and limited the response to 2 pages max (`page_limit = 2`). In addition, we know that exactly 2 pages were actually retrieved, since there are 6 items and we said each page should only contain 3 items (`"per_page" => 3`).

The values provided by `page_data` are the same values that are included in the [Link header](https://developer.github.com/v3/#link-header) of the last requested item. You can continue paginating by starting a new paginated request at one of these links using the `start_page` keyword argument:

```julia
# Continue paging, starting with `page_data["next"]`.
# Note that the `params` kwarg can't be used here because
# the link passed to `start_page` has its own parameters
julia> prs2, page_data2 = pull_requests("JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl"; page_limit = 2, start_page = page_data["next"]);

julia> prs2
6-element Array{GitHub.PullRequest,1}:
 GitHub.PullRequest(37)
 GitHub.PullRequest(34)
 GitHub.PullRequest(32)
 GitHub.PullRequest(30)
 GitHub.PullRequest(24)
 GitHub.PullRequest(22)

julia> page_data2
Dict{String,String} with 4 entries:
  "prev"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=4&per_page=3&state=all"
  "next"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=6&per_page=3&state=all"
  "first" => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=1&per_page=3&state=all"
  "last"  => "https://api.github.com/repositories/16635105/pulls?page=7&per_page=3&state=all"
```

## Handling Webhook Events

GitHub.jl comes with configurable `EventListener` and `CommentListener` types that can be used as basic servers for parsing and responding to events delivered by [GitHub's repository Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).

#### `EventListener`

When an `EventListener` receives an event, it performs some basic validation and wraps the event payload (and some other data) in [a `WebhookEvent` type](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/blob/master/src/activity/events/events.jl). This `WebhookEvent` instance, along with the provided `Authorization`, is then fed to the server's handler function, which the user defines to determine the server's response behavior. The handler function is expected to return an `HTTP.Response` that is then sent back to GitHub.

The `EventListener` constructor takes the following keyword arguments:

- `auth`: GitHub authorization (usually with repo-level permissions).
- `secret`: A string used to verify the event source. If the event is from a GitHub Webhook, it's the Webhook's secret. If a secret is not provided, the server won't validate the secret signature of incoming requests.
- `repos`: A vector of `Repo`s (or fully qualified repository names) listing all acceptable repositories. All repositories are whitelisted by default.
- `events`: A vector of [event names](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) listing all acceptable events (e.g. ["commit_comment", "pull_request"]). All events are whitelisted by default.
- `forwards`: A vector of `HTTP.URI`s (or URI strings) to which any incoming requests should be forwarded (after being validated by the listener)

Here's an example that demonstrates how to construct and run an `EventListener` that does benchmarking on every commit and PR:

```julia
import GitHub

# EventListener settings
myauth = GitHub.authenticate(ENV["GITHUB_AUTH"])
mysecret = ENV["MY_SECRET"]
myevents = ["pull_request", "push"]
myrepos = [GitHub.Repo("owner1/repo1"), "owner2/repo2"] # can be Repos or repo names
myforwards = [HTTP.URI("http://myforward1.com"), "http://myforward2.com"] # can be HTTP.URIs or URI strings

# Set up Status parameters
pending_params = Dict(
    "state" => "pending",
    "context" => "Benchmarker",
    "description" => "Running benchmarks..."
)

success_params = Dict(
    "state" => "success",
    "context" => "Benchmarker",
    "description" => "Benchmarks complete!"
)

error_params(err) = Dict(
    "state" => "error",
    "context" => "Benchmarker",
    "description" => "Error: $err"
)

# We can use Julia's `do` notation to set up the listener's handler function
listener = GitHub.EventListener(auth = myauth,
                                secret = mysecret,
                                repos = myrepos,
                                events = myevents,
                                forwards = myforwards) do event
    kind, payload, repo = event.kind, event.payload, event.repository

    if kind == "pull_request" && payload["action"] == "closed"
        return HTTP.Response(200)
    end

    if event.kind == "push"
        sha = event.payload["after"]
    elseif event.kind == "pull_request"
        sha = event.payload["pull_request"]["head"]["sha"]
    end

    GitHub.create_status(repo, sha; auth = myauth, params = pending_params)

    try
        # run_and_log_benchmarks isn't actually a defined function, but you get the point
        run_and_log_benchmarks(event, "\$(sha)-benchmarks.csv")
    catch err
        GitHub.create_status(repo, sha; auth = myauth, params = error_params(err))
        return HTTP.Response(500)
    end

    GitHub.create_status(repo, sha; auth = myauth, params = success_params)

    return HTTP.Response(200)
end

# Start the listener on localhost at port 8000
GitHub.run(listener, IPv4(127,0,0,1), 8000)
```

#### `CommentListener`

A `CommentListener` is a special kind of `EventListener` that allows users to pass data to the listener's handler function via commenting. This is useful for triggering events on repositories that require configuration settings.

A `CommentListener` automatically filters out all non-comment events, and then checks the body of each comment event against a trigger `Regex` supplied by the user. If a match is found in the comment, then the `CommentListener` calls its handler function, passing it the event and the corresponding `RegexMatch`.

The `CommentListener` constructor takes the following keyword arguments:

- `auth`: same as `EventListener`
- `secret`: same as `EventListener`
- `repos`: same as `EventListener`
- `forwards`: same as `EventListener`
- `check_collab`: If `true`, only acknowledge comments made by repository collaborators. Note that, if `check_collab` is `true`, `auth` must have the appropriate permissions to query the comment's repository for the collaborator status of the commenter. `check_collab` is `true` by default.
- `use_access_token`: If `check_collab` is set to `true` and `auth` is using JWT authentication for GitHub Apps, then set this to `true`.

For example, let's set up a silly `CommentListener` that responds to the commenter with a greeting. To give a demonstration of the desired behavior, if a collaborator makes a comment like:

```
Man, I really would like to be greeted today.

`sayhello("Bob", "outgoing")`
```

We want the `CommentLister` to reply:

```
Hello, Bob, you look very outgoing today!
```

Here's the code that will make this happen:

```julia
import GitHub

# CommentListener settings
trigger = r"`sayhello\(.*?\)`"
myauth = GitHub.authenticate(ENV["GITHUB_AUTH"])
mysecret = ENV["MY_SECRET"]

# We can use Julia's `do` notation to set up the listener's handler function.
# Note that, in our example case, `phrase` will be "`sayhello(\"Bob\", \"outgoing\")`"
listener = GitHub.CommentListener(trigger; auth = myauth, secret = mysecret) do event, phrase
    # In our example case, this code sets name to "Bob" and adjective to "outgoing"
    name, adjective = matchall(r"\".*?\"", phrase)
    comment_params = Dict("body" => "Hello, $name, you look very $adjective today!")

    # Parse the original comment event for all the necessary reply info
    comment = GitHub.Comment(event.payload["comment"])

    if event.kind == "issue_comment"
        comment_kind = :issue
        reply_to = event.payload["issue"]["number"]
    elseif event.kind == "commit_comment"
        comment_kind = :commit
        reply_to = comment.commit_id
    elseif event.kind == "pull_request_review_comment"
        comment_kind = :review
        reply_to = event.payload["pull_request"]["number"]
        # load required query params for review comment creation
        comment_params["commit_id"] = comment.commit_id
        comment_params["path"] = comment.path
        comment_params["position"] = comment.position
    end

    # send the comment creation request to GitHub
    GitHub.create_comment(event.repository, reply_to, comment_kind; auth = myauth, params = comment_params)

    return HTTP.Response(200)
end

# Start the listener on localhost at port 8000
GitHub.run(listener, IPv4(127,0,0,1), 8000)
```
